How to Play:

Press any Alphabet key to start game. Non alpha keys are ignored. The theme of the game is 'Batman: Guess the Villian'. The game will randomly select a Batman villian. A blank word is displayed using underscores to represent the letters in the word. It is possible to have a multi-named villian such as Arkham Knight.

If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct location. If an incorrect letter is selected, then it will add the letter to a list on incorrectly guessed letters at the bottom of the page and decrement the remaining guesses count.

If the user guesses the correct villian name before remaining guesses equal zero, then the game increments the number of wins, plays a win sound and restarts the game by selecting a new random villian name and resets game parameters.

If the user does not guess the correct villian within the allocated number of guesses, then the game plays a lose sound and resets.
